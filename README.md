# APP NAME

## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️How we built it

- ML: Python, MATLAB
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Django
- Authentication: Auth0

## 🤖 Best Use of MATLAB

We used MATLAB to build the sentiment analysis model. The model was trained on a dataset of emotions and their corresponding sentiment. The model was then used to predict the sentiment of a given sentence user input for the diary. MATLAB helped us in the following ways:

- We used the MATLAB function `textscan` to parse the user input into a matrix.
- We used the MATLAB function `strsplit` to split the user input into individual words.
- We used the MATLAB function `strcat` to concatenate the words into a single string.

## 🔑 Auth0

We used Auth0 authentication system for LogIn of users because we wanted to make an application very very secure. Auth0 provides the most extensive functionality to ensure the user authentication and authorization, with detailed analytics, a variety of available providers, and a diverse set of user-friendly tools the developer will really like. During the app development, we used social services to log-in like using Google which supported by Auth0.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Using MATLAB to build the model was a challenge.
- Completing the project under given time frame.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We built the sentiment analysis model using MATLAB.
- Implementing the sentiment analysis model to the frontend.
